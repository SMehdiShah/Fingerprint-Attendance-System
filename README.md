#  **Fingerprint-Attendance-System**

##  Overview
The **Fingerprint-Attendance-System** is a biometric attendance solution that enables students to mark their attendance using a **fingerprint sensor** connected to an **ESP32 microcontroller**. The attendance records are automatically updated in **Google Sheets**, ensuring a paperless and efficient system.

This project aims to replace traditional manual attendance methods with a secure and automated system, reducing human error and enhancing reliability.

## Installation & Setup

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Install Required Libraries  
Open **Arduino IDE** and install the following libraries:
- **Adafruit Fingerprint Sensor Library** (via Library Manager)
- **WiFi Library** (for ESP32)
- **HTTPClient Library** (for Google Sheets integration)

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Set Up ESP32 in Arduino IDE   
- To set up the **ESP32 in Arduino IDE**, you need to configure the environment by installing the necessary board definitions. 
- This involves adding the ESP32 package to the **Board Manager** and selecting the appropriate **ESP32 development module**. 
- Once configured, the Arduino IDE will be able to recognize and upload code to the **ESP32 microcontroller**.  

- Go to **Tools** ‚Üí **Board** ‚Üí **ESP32** ‚Üí Select **ESP32 Dev Module**.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Set Up Google Sheets Integration  
- Enable **Google Sheets API** in the Google Cloud Console.  
- Generate **API credentials** and obtain the **Google Sheets API key**.  
- Share the Google Sheet with the generated API email.  

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Upload the Code to ESP32  
- Connect ESP32 to your computer.  
- Open **Arduino IDE**, load the fingerprint attendance code, and upload it.

##  Usage Guide

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Enroll a New Fingerprint  
1. Run the enrollment script on ESP32.  
2. Place the student's finger on the sensor.  
3. The system will capture and store the fingerprint in memory.  

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Mark Attendance  
1. The student places their finger on the sensor.  
2. If the fingerprint matches a stored record, attendance is marked in **Google Sheets**.  
3. If the fingerprint does not match, an error message is displayed.  

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Check Attendance  
- Open **Google Sheets** to view attendance records, including **name, roll number, date, and time**.  

---

## Error Handling
- **Fingerprint Not Found** ‚Äì Displays a message if the fingerprint does not match any stored records.  
- **Sensor Connection Issue** ‚Äì Ensures proper wiring and sensor connection.  
- **Google Sheets API Failure** ‚Äì Checks internet connectivity and API key.
